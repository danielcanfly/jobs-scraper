# Changelog

## v1.1.1 — 2026-08-24

Narrow repository-hygiene hardening release. Scraper business behaviour is unchanged from v1.1.0.

- Replaced the private-workbook-oriented `RULES.md` with a public-safe technical reference.
- Removed package-author production worksheet metadata from current tracked text, including a legacy CLI help example and historical test literals.
- Added `scripts/check_repo_hygiene.py`, which scans the entire Git-tracked tree for known production identifiers, concrete Google Sheet URLs, service-account identities, and private-key material.
- Replaced the previous hand-picked CI production-ID grep with the repository-wide hygiene guard.
- Updated package, plugin, Agent Skill, MCP server, and `uv.lock` patch-version identity to `1.1.1`.
- Corrected the dependency-file MCP tool-count comment to include `initialize_job_tracker`.
- Moved the stale v1.0 repair-stage status report out of the repository root into `docs/history/v1.0-repair-result.md`, with an explicit historical-only banner.

Explicitly unchanged:

- LinkedIn/Jora/JobStreet URL construction and source crawling behaviour.
- JobStreet GraphQL JD retrieval.
- JD parsing, title filters, dedup, work-mode and visa semantics.
- Google Sheet row-write ordering and A:K scraper ownership.
- Legacy `server.py` behaviour.

## v1.1.0 — 2026-08-23

Added portable Region-Raw / Region-Selected Google Sheet onboarding, the A:AA Job Tracker Schema v1, atomic tracker initialization, and region-aware v1.1 MCP tools without requiring users to configure a worksheet GID.

## v1.0.0 — 2026-08-23

First independently qualified release of the multi-source scraper, local Agent Skill, and local STDIO MCP workflow.
